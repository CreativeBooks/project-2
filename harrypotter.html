                            Ravenclaw was one of four Hogwarts houses and prized students whose <b>focus was on
                                learning, wit and wisdom. </b>This reflected the nature of their founder, Rowena
                            Ravenclaw who was known to be a woman of remarkable diligence and intelligence. The
                            Ravenclaw common room was decorated with the house colours of blue and bronze along with
                            their eagle emblem. The students were able to study hard in the rooms that were full of
                            tables and bookcases, although if they were unable to solve the bronze knockerâ€™s riddle they
                            couldn't get in until someone arrived who could!

                            </b>The house colours were scarlet and gold, and the emblematic animal was a lion, which

                            Weasley children, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, all four Marauders and Albus Dumbledore.
                            Gryffindor students embraced a long held rivalry with Slytherin house although they were
                            largely friendly with Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students.

                            Slytherin was one of the four Hogwarts houses and was characterised by its silver and green
                            colours and serpent emblem. Founded by Salazar Slytherin, the students sent to Slytherin
                            were representative of his preference for <b>characters defined by cunning, pride and
                                ambition. </b> Suspicions about the house's connections to the Dark Arts were hard to
                            dispel, particularly as it was the house of Lord Voldemort and boasted a number of Death
                            Eaters and their children. However, Slytherin had a lot of members that contradicted this
                            reputation. For instance, renowned wizard Merlin reigned from Slytherin, and some of the
                            future generations, such as Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius, proved that you could be a
                            Slytherin and still be kind.

                            duffers' they were actually well known to be kind, reliable and honest. The house's colours
                            were black and yellow and its emblem a badger. These colours decorated the walls of
                            Hufflepuff's underground common room, which featured cosy burrow-like rooms, resembling a
